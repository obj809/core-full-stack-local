## Lessons learned

### Full-stack Dev Blueprint

- create a new development branch
- start with database
- connect backend api with database and test with postman (local)
- create .env file for sensitive variables and import
- create and connect the frontend with the api
- pass data through the frontend, to the api and test the database

- connect to a remote database 
- write a script to connect to the cloud database and access an interface to check the cloud database data
- create docker files in each directory and for the container
- build the docker images and run the container
- access the app through the container and test the remote database with postman

### Current step

- connect with the GCP Cloud database with the test_db_connection script (might need to allow access on the GCP platform)
